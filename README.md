# Data Science

This is a complete course to understand data science and requirements.

## Complete  Roadmap To understand Data Science

**Diagram**


==========================================================
## Server Handling
Data science is an emerging fiels with numerous opportunities. Every data scientist require a skill of handling
data from server. Here, I would like to talk about SQL and NoSQL.

First, what is `DBMS`, RDBMS` and `Non RDBMS` ?

***DBMS***

Database Management System is a special software program that helps users to create and maintain database.

Basically, database management is a `C.R.U.D`.


- C -- Create
- R -- Read/Retrive
- U -- Update
- D -- Delete


***RDBMS***

Relational Database Mangement System --- MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and etc.

*** Non RDBMS***

Non Relational database Management Systme --- NoSQL, i.e. MongoDB, dynamoDB, Apache, Cassandra

-------------------------------------------------------

**SQL**

Structured Querry Language(SQL) is a sequal database. it is a `Relational Database`. In SQL, each table has columns and rows. In SQL we called attribute to single column and entry to single row.

***Key***

In SQL, we need to understnad about keys before understnading data system.

Here are few keys:








**NoSQL**


## Statistics & Mathematics
https://peterroelants.github.io/posts/gaussian-process-tutorial/

**Few stat concepts**
- Mean, median, sd, variance, co-variance
- EDA concept

**Mathematics**
-Linear Algebra

- matrices and multiplication, eigen vectors
- Calculus

## Data visualization $ Interpolation

- Visualize with code
    - Libraries
- Tabelu
- Excel


## Data Preprocessing

**EDA**
**FFT**

**Data Cleaning**
- Fill empty entry
- Delete unnecessary entries
- Separate dependent and independent variables
- One hot encoding
- Make train and test datset 

## Model Development

### Supervisor and Unsupervisor
### Classification and Regeression
### Algorithms
### Train Model


## Model Deployment

### Test model with test dataset and new dataset for presiction
### Deploy model in API
### Send result to  server or dash board  

## Make Decision

### How to make predictions
