# Data Science

This is a complete course to understand data science and requirements.

## Complete  Roadmap To understand Data Science

**Diagram**

## Server Handling
Data science is an emerging fiels with numerous opportunities. Every data scientist require a skill of handling
data from server. Here, I would like to talk about SQL and NoSQL.

Before moving to SQL and NoSQL, I would like to give short introduction of `DBMS`.

***DBMS***

Database Management System is a special software program that helps users to create and maintain database.


**SQL**

Structured Querry Language(SQL) is a sequal database. it is a `Relational Database`. In SQL, each table has columns and rows.





**NoSQL**


## Statistics & Mathematics

**Few stat concepts**
- Mean, median, sd, variance, co-variance
- EDA concept

**Mathematics**
-Linear Algebra

- matrices and multiplication, eigen vectors
- Calculus

## Data visualization $ Interpolation

- Visualize with code
    - Libraries
- Tabelu
- Excel


## Data Preprocessing

**EDA**
**FFT**

**Data Cleaning**
- Fill empty entry
- Delete unnecessary entries
- Separate dependent and independent variables
- One hot encoding
- Make train and test datset 

## Model Development

### Train Model


## Model Deployment

### Test model with test dataset and new dataset for presiction
### Deploy model in API
### Send result to  server or dash board  

## Make Decision

### How to make predictions
